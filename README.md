Step 1: Create a New Jetpack Compose Project
Install Android Studio: Make sure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed on your machine.

Create a New Project in Android Studio:

Open Android Studio and select Create New Project.
Choose the Empty Compose Activity template (this template provides the basic setup for a Jetpack Compose project).
Fill in your project details:
Name: Choose a name for your app.
Package name: Define the package name.
Save location: Choose where to store the project.
Language: Select Kotlin.
Minimum API level: Choose the minimum API level (usually API 21 or higher is fine for most Compose projects).
Finish the Setup:

Click Finish to create the project. Android Studio will set up the necessary files and dependencies for Jetpack Compose.
Verify Jetpack Compose Setup: Open the project, and check the following files to ensure Jetpack Compose is set up correctly:

build.gradle (Project level) should have the following dependencies:
groovy
Copy code
buildscript {
    ext {
        compose_version = '1.3.0' // Update to the latest Compose version
    }
    ...
}
build.gradle (App level) should include:
groovy
Copy code
dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui:$compose_version"
    implementation "androidx.compose.material:material:$compose_version"
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling-preview:$compose_version"
    ...
}
If you're using the latest Android Studio, Jetpack Compose will typically be automatically set up when you choose the Empty Compose Activity template.
