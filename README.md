## Step 1: Create a New Jetpack Compose Project
Make sure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed on your machine.

## Create a New Project in Android Studio:
* Open Android Studio and select Create New Project.
* Choose the Empty Compose Activity template (this template provides the basic setup for a Jetpack Compose project).
* Fill in your project details:
* Name: Choose a name for your app.
* Package name: Define the package name.
* Save location: Choose where to store the project.
* Language: Select Kotlin.
* Minimum API level: Choose the minimum API level (usually API 21 or higher is fine for most Compose projects).
* Finish the Setup:
Click Finish to create the project. Android Studio will set up the necessary files and dependencies for Jetpack Compose.

## Install Android Studio
* Download Studio `https://developer.android.com/studio` and once installed, launch Android Studio.
* Open Your Project & Open an existing project from the Android Studio home screen.
*Navigate to your project folder and select the root folder of your Android project.
* Once your project is open, Android Studio will automatically sync the Gradle files.
* Wait for the sync to complete. You’ll see a progress bar at the bottom, and Android Studio will fetch dependencies and configure your project for build.

### For Devices
*  Select a Device/Emulator `Connect your Android phone or tablet to your computer using a USB cable`. Enable Developer Options and USB Debugging on your device:
* Android Studio should automatically detect the device. If it doesn’t, make sure the appropriate drivers are installed for your device.
* Select your device from the Device Selector dropdown in the top toolbar.

### For Amulator
* You can use an Android emulator.
* In Android Studio, click the AVD Manager icon in the toolbar.
* Create a new virtual device with the configuration you prefer (you can choose from predefined device templates).
* Select a system image (such as Google’s standard Android image) and follow the prompts to finish.
* Once your emulator is set up, select it from the Device Selector dropdown.
* Build the Project
* Android Studio will automatically build the project when you select a device and run the project.
* Run the Project
